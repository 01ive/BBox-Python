# BBox Python API

This components is a Python wrapper to the Bouygues Telecom Internet access router (called "box").

This project is extracted from an other personnal project so maybe it will required a bit of work to make it run. But the overhall ideas are there.

This code has been written using documentation and exemples found here: https://api.bbox.fr/doc/apirouter/index.html

Enjoy !
